# Twixxer Project Plan

This document outlines the development plan, roadmap, and milestones for the Twixxer project.

## Project Overview

Twixxer is a React application built with React Router v7 using a server-side rendering (SSR) approach. The project aims to create a modern social media platform with a focus on user experience, performance, and scalability.

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Current)

**Objective**: Establish the core architecture and basic functionality.

**Key Deliverables**:
- Set up project structure with React, TypeScript, and Vite
- Implement server-side rendering with React Router v7
- Create database schema and ORM integration with DrizzleORM
- Develop basic authentication system (signup, login, logout)
- Implement basic user profile functionality
- Create initial UI components with TailwindCSS

**Timeline**: Q2 2023 - Q3 2023

### Phase 2: Core Features

**Objective**: Implement essential social media features and improve user experience.

**Key Deliverables**:
- Develop post creation and interaction functionality
- Implement following/follower system
- Create notification system
- Add search functionality
- Enhance user profiles with customization options
- Implement responsive design for mobile devices
- Add basic analytics tracking

**Timeline**: Q4 2023 - Q1 2024

### Phase 3: Enhancement and Scaling

**Objective**: Improve performance, add advanced features, and prepare for scaling.

**Key Deliverables**:
- Implement caching strategy with Redis
- Add real-time updates with WebSockets
- Develop direct messaging functionality
- Create content moderation tools
- Implement advanced analytics dashboard
- Optimize for performance and scalability
- Add internationalization support

**Timeline**: Q2 2024 - Q3 2024

### Phase 4: Refinement and Launch

**Objective**: Polish the application, conduct thorough testing, and prepare for public launch.

**Key Deliverables**:
- Conduct comprehensive security audit
- Perform load testing and optimization
- Implement feedback from beta users
- Finalize documentation
- Develop marketing materials
- Set up production infrastructure
- Launch public beta

**Timeline**: Q4 2024

## Resource Allocation

### Development Team
- 2 Frontend Developers
- 2 Backend Developers
- 1 UI/UX Designer
- 1 DevOps Engineer
- 1 Project Manager

### Infrastructure
- Development environment: Local Docker setup
- Staging environment: AWS ECS
- Production environment: AWS ECS with auto-scaling

## Risk Management

### Identified Risks
1. **Technical Complexity**: The SSR approach with React Router v7 is relatively new and may present unexpected challenges.
   - Mitigation: Allocate time for research and prototyping; maintain close communication with the React Router community.

2. **Performance Concerns**: Social media applications require high performance with large datasets.
   - Mitigation: Implement performance testing early; design with scalability in mind from the start.

3. **Security Vulnerabilities**: Social platforms are common targets for security attacks.
   - Mitigation: Regular security audits; follow security best practices; implement proper authentication and authorization.

4. **Scope Creep**: Social media features can expand indefinitely.
   - Mitigation: Strict prioritization; regular backlog refinement; clear definition of MVP.

## Success Metrics

- User registration and retention rates
- Content engagement metrics (posts, comments, likes)
- Performance metrics (load time, time to interactive)
- Error rates and system stability
- User satisfaction through feedback and surveys

## Next Steps

1. Complete the remaining tasks in Phase 1
2. Begin planning detailed implementation for Phase 2 features
3. Establish regular testing and review cycles
4. Set up analytics to track progress against success metrics
